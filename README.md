# Music Library Validator
This is a script that iterates my personal music library and ensures the directory and file structure, as well as song metadata, matches the format I prefer.

It also generates a report of any discrepancies it finds.

This is tailored to certain weird edge cases and specific guidelines I want my library to follow but feel free to fork it or something if you want to use it for yourself.
